# Linkedin to twitter posts

This is a very easy application that integrates with a no-code flow on Make.com.
It takes a long post, that i usually write in Italian for LinkedIn, translates it and splits it into multiple tweets. 
Than stores the tweets on a google sheet and a Notion Database.

You can integrate the make process, importing the blueprint.json file you find in the root folder, directly in your own make account, so you can customize the place you store your data in.

This was just a small experiment in interaction between a codeful application and a no code flow. Enjoy ;)
